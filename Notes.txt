I'm a quant develop and I want to do a project with March Madness.

1. I want to get some data about college basketball this year
2. I also want to get some data about historical college basketball and use a "factor investing" model to 
create accurate brackets and backtest the model
3. I want to use the data to predict the outcome of the tournament
4. I want to use Go and Python to develop a web application to view the data and make predictions
5. I want to use Go and Python to develop a backtest framework to test different strategies and models
